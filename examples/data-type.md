# Verification of data types

**RML** allows the verification of several data types, including **FIFO** queues and lists, which require a formalism 
more powerful than context-free grammars. Specifications are implementation independent, therefore
they can be used to verify different implementations of the same data type, also with different programming languages (provided
that an instrumentation to generate events is available).
